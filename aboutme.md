My name is Limeng Ge. You can also call me Chloe. I’m a junior majoring in Philosophy at East China Normal University and currently an international exchange student at New York University. I have the following qualities:

- Critical and Analytical Thinker
- Effective Communicator
- Innovative Problem-Solver

With a foundation in computer language and data analysis, I’m particularly focused on applying these skills in public policy, international relations, and data analysis within the non-profit and international organization sectors. 

Outside of work, I have a deep appreciation for music and the arts, having studied piano and cello for over a decade. I also enjoy gaming for its storytelling and design, and I find inspiration in documentaries that explore diverse cultures and perspectives.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
